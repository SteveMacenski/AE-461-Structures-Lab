Codes for Pre-labs and Labs for AE 461


This course covered a variety of experimental features of composites and other structures. Labs include carbon fiber manufacturing and testing, beam buckling, photoelasticity, bending and torsion, and more. 

This is my working code for completing prelabs and are not themselves sufficient representations of the prelabs. This is meant as a version control access for myself when in remote places. No solutions or question prompts will be posted here.
